# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to compare rural, suburban, and city PyBer data. First, we were to sort the data by city type. Next, generated a summary dataframe showing total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type. Finally, we found the total sales by week between 2019-01-01 and 2019-04-08 for each city type and generated a multiple line chart using matplotlib.

### Resources
- Data Source(s): city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
